# MOF-Capstone
Power generation is one of the leading greenhouse gas emission sources and a key driver of climate change. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are nanoporous materials that are great candidates for carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) processes due to their highly tuneable chemical and structural properties. My goal in this project was to use the [ARC-MOF](https://zenodo.org/record/6908728#.ZB22pHbMI2w) database of calculated MOF properties to generate a predictive model that can help steer chemists in the lab towards the best possible carbon capture material.

## 6. Future Work
Going forward I have two paths I'd like to explore: digging deeper, and collaborating. In terms of digging deeper, I'd like to find additional datasets that can be added to this work to help find if these models can be improved further, and possibly identify other MOF features which may help improve this guidance. I also think it would be very interesting to collaborate with MOF research groups to actually design and synthesize some MOFs based on these recommendations to put them to the test. There are many challenges to synthesizing MOFs, so I would like to see if we could actually design and then create a MOF that should theoretically perform well as a CCS adsorbent.

## 7. Credits
I'd like to first and foremost thank my Springboard mentor Upom Malik for helping me find this dataset and develop this project idea. Finding MOF datasets that could be aligned to develop a machine learning project was quite a challenge, and his help was invaluable. I'd also like to thank the [ARC-MOF authors](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemmater.2c02485) for their work developing this database. This project wouldn't be possible without their efforts.
