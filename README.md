# MOF-Capstone
Power generation is one of the leading greenhouse gas emission sources and a key driver of climate change. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are nanoporous materials that are great candidates for carbon capture and sequestration processes due to their highly tuneable chemical and structural properties. My goal in this project was to use the [ARC-MOF]() database of calculated MOF properties to generate a predictive model that can help steer chemists in the lab towards the best possible carbon capture material.
